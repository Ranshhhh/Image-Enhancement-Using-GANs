🖼️ Project Overview
Enhancing Image Using GAN is a project that uses the power of Generative Adversarial Networks to improve image quality. The model is trained to enhance low-resolution, blurred, or noisy images, making it perfect for applications in photography, video production, and more.

Goal: Enhance low-quality images using a deep learning model to produce high-resolution, clear, and sharp images.

🌟 Features
Generative Adversarial Network: A powerful model that learns through adversarial training.
Image Quality Improvement: Enhance image resolution, reduce noise, and sharpen features.
Easy-to-Use Interface: Straightforward scripts for training, testing, and deploying the model.
Open-Source and Community Driven: Contributions and improvements are encouraged!
🧠 Architecture
The project is based on a GAN architecture that includes:

Generator: Responsible for generating enhanced images from input low-resolution images.
Discriminator: Helps the model learn by distinguishing between real and generated images, pushing the generator to produce more realistic outputs.

⚙️ Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enhancing-image-gan.git
Navigate to the project folder:
bash
Copy code
cd enhancing-image-gan
Install required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage
1. Training the Model 🏋️‍♂️
Run the following command to start training the GAN model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --dataset_path <path_to_dataset>
2. Testing the Model 🧪
After training, you can test the model with your own images:

bash
Copy code
python test.py --input_image <path_to_image> --output_dir <path_to_output_dir>
3. Pre-trained Model 🎉
If you want to skip training, we’ve provided a pre-trained model. You can download it here and use it directly.

📂 Datasets
For this project, we used high-resolution image datasets from sources such as:

DIV2K: A dataset for image restoration.
Flickr Faces HQ: High-quality face images.
Refer to the datasets/README.md for more information on setting up datasets.
